## Representation with a Feature Cross - Exercise (California Housing Dataset)
On previous exercises, we trained on only 1 feature, but this one trains on 2. They will be stored in a TensorFlow proprietary structure `tf.feature_column` that allows the representation of a **single feature**, **single feature cross** or **single synthetic feature** in a desired way.

To represent a feature as floating-points values, we use [`tf.feature_column`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/feature_column). When we want to use bins/buckets, there's the [`tf.feature_column.bucketized_column`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/feature_column/bucketized_column) option.

Note that these representations still need to be appended to a Python list.

For this exercise, we scrub the latitude and longitude columns from the .csv document to use as our features, and store them in a list:
```py
#Empty list to store all the feature columns
feature_columns = []

#Columns with latitude floating-point values 
latitude = tf.feature_column.numeric_column("latitude")
feature_columns.append(latitude)

#Columns with longitude floating-point values 
longitude = tf.feature_column.numeric_column("longitude")
feature_columns.append(longitude)

#Creation of a layer (part of the model)
fp_feature_layer = layers.DenseFeatures(feature_columns)
```

The layer will process the raw inputs according to the transformations described by the feature columns, and pack the results into a numeric array that the model, ultimately, will train on.
