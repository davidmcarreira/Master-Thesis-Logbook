# Reunião 18/03/2022
# Tópicos discutidos:
Estruturar a tese (frases chave, notas importantes, conclusões, gráficos, resultados importantes ou inesperados).
Rever o SOTA (atualização em termos de novo conhecimento/conclusões)

Ir apontando as ditas conclusões para depois ter material para a versão final e não ficar perdido.
 **Muito importante** fazer um planeamento temporal da tese para ter noção se estou atrasado ou adiantado.
 
# TBD
- [ ] Fazer um planeamento temporal da tese
- [ ] Criar repo à parte para código

# Machine Learning - Google Crash Course
## First Steps with TensorFlow
TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source library for machine learning designed to manage all aspects of a machine learning system.

### Introduction to TensorFlow
**TensorFlow APIs** are arranged in a hierarchical way, with high-level API built on top of the low-level ones. One example of a high-level object-oriented API is the `tf.keras`, a TensorFlow variant of the open-source Keras API (Python library that provides an interface for artificial neural networks, it's used usually for deep learning contexts). The low-level APIs are more used for conventional machine learning and to create

The TensorFlow toolkit hierarchy is as it follows:

As we can see in the previous graphics, low-level APIs are closer to the hardware, hence their name. That also means that they have a different level of abstraction (filtering out the characteristics that we don't need, in order to focus on what we do) so they're more complex and have more functions, but are harder to implement. The high-level APIs are, in a sense, the opposite (but no literally).


`NumPy` allows the creation and manipulation of mathematical arrays, while `pandas` has a structure called DataFrame, that is a two-dimensional and size-mutable. It also supports heterogeneous tabular data, labeled axes and arithmetic operations. A DataFrame can be seen as a *dict-like* container, i.e, a two-dimensional dictionary. It's a glorified spreadsheet.
